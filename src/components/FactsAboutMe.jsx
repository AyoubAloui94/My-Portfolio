        <FactTitle>How I became a developer</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>
          Towards the end of 2019, 2 friends of mine launched an E-commerce startup and needed a web developer so I stepped up since I was the only one out of the 3 of us who had any web development knowledge. Then Covid lockdowns happened and I had more free time to learn and practice my programming skills. I have been writing code ever since. (

        <FactTitle>My favorite library</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>My favorite library is Reactjs. I know this a controversial thing to say as some consider it a framework and not a library, but let&lsquo;s not get into that here ðŸ˜… I love the JSX syntax and the ability to use React-hooks (no pun intended) with functional components and I truly enjoy building React apps. Matter of fact, this portfolio site of mine is built with React as a SPA using React-Router-Dom and React-Query to fetch my portfolio projects from the Github API.</FactBody>

      <Fact>
        <FactTitle>How I would describe myself</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>I have a strong memory and an analytical brain. I thrive in fierce competition and constantly feel the need to get better at whatever I do. I am a little bit of a math-head (emphasis on the &lsquo;a&lsquo; in math) in how I do things, always trying to see the full picture first and then zooming-in on the details in a calculated manner. I am a very fast learner.</FactBody>
      </Fact>
      <Fact>
        <FactTitle>My biggest strength</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>Problem solving: my good analytical memory and scientific background allow me to approach issues as math problems and figure out solutions through extensive research, thinking outside the box and not giving up until I am able to solve the problem at hand.</FactBody>
      </Fact>
      <Fact>
        <FactTitle>My biggest weakness</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>Being unable to switch off while a problem is unsolved: figures that my biggest weakness has to do with my biggest strength, but it&lsquo;s true. Not being able to figure out the solution to a problem can make it live rent free in my head to the point of obsession sometimes, until I can finally figure it out.</FactBody>
      </Fact>
      <Fact>
        <FactTitle>Hobbies</FactTitle>
        <FactBody>Cooking, listening to music (mostly Metal), keeping and breeding fish, indoor gardening, programming (yup, I also enjoy writing code in my free time)</FactBody>

// <FactBody>Being unable to switch off while a problem is unsolved: figures that my biggest weakness has to do with my biggest strength, but it&lsquo;s true, solving problems for me is a double-edged sword. Not being able to figure out the solution to a problem can make me pause everything else or not do anything else until that one problem is solved, sometimes it gets to the point of obsession where I barely can sleep and whenever I do I dream about that one problem and keep thinking of ways to solve it. My work-around is, if it happens while building an app for example, whenever I can tell that a certain task is gonna be problematic, to take care of everything else I can and try to research the problem during my short breaks, and only fully jump into solving it once everything else is basically done. Only downside is sometimes complex problems don&lsquo;t give you a heads-up and so if you&lsquo;re like me, you go down that wormhole...</FactBody>
